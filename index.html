                <p>
                    At 26 years old, I have spent the majority of my career refining my
                    sales skills in the industrial machinery world. Having worked on
                    projects with international players such as Dart Container, Proctor and
                    Gamble, and TREX I have refined my soft skills and cooperation acumen to
                    facilitate a change of careers into the tech world. Although most would
                    not consider sales as any way analogous to computer programming, the
                    basic interaction skills required to work in a team of developers
                    translates nearly 1:1. Dealing with difficult customers refines the
                    level-headedness required to work with difficult teammembers and
                    managers. The face-to-face assertiveness required to tell a customer
                    their project is going to cost them half a million dollars more than
                    they thought or that their project has been delayed by 3 months
                    translates well to stepping into a leadership type role without being a
                    steamroller.

                <h4>Carolina Fintech Hub WIN Program (February 2021 - present)</h4>
                <p>
                    For the majority of 2021, I have been pursuing my dream of
                    working in the tech field through the WIN program by Carolina
                    Fintech Hub. This program allowed me to transition full time
                    from sales to learning the ins and out of front and backend
                    development. After the extensive application program and then
                    being acepted, our team has worked tirelessly to mold ourselves
                    into fully fledged fullstack developers. Starting with the
                    basics and HTML, CSS, and Javascript frontend development, we
                    learned at a breakneck pace before turning abruptly into backend
                    development with Java. This 24 week program culminated in a 4
                    week long capstone project with a team put together from the
                    attendees of the WIN program.
                </p>
                <h4>eFactor3 (January 2016 - February 2021)</h4>
                <p>
                    In my sales role at eFactor3, I focused on things like client
                    relationship management, the creation of technical proposals,
                    and project management skills to put together industrial
                    processes from the machine manufacturers I represented. I
                    traveled extensively to meet with current and potential
                    customers and deliver presentations pertinent to their needs and
                    specific industry. What this experience really did for me is
                    help me build my self-confidence, assertiveness, negotiation
                    skills and tactics, and almost every other interpersonal skill
                    required to work in high-pressure professional environments.
